Note: you will be prompted for any values not in `config`
and no files will be overwritten without your confirmation

  $ fsplate Makefile

  # rename
  $ fsplate -r Readme.md
  Readme.md is available. prefered name: $

  # target a sub-directory
  $ fsplate component my-component
```

## template language

templates are just normal files and directories. By default fsplates searches within `~/.fsplates` for a the template you call. It will then walk through each file in the template (if its a directory) and replace variables with values. variables are denoted by double mustaches `{{var here}}`. values are looked up within `~/.fsplates/.config.json`. Any values not found will be prompted for. The resulting Files are written to the working directory though you can specify a target. Don't worry about files being overwritten, fsplates, will prompt before doing anything dangerous. File paths can also contain mustaches so you can literally put them anywhere! Check out the `./dots` directory for example templates.
